# Who are we?
We are a small, agile team, responsible for the specification,
development, installation, commissioning and testing of a multi-million pound
automated warehouse.

# Where are we?
We are based at John Lewis Magna Park on the outskirts of Milton Keynes.

John Lewis Magna Park is one of the largest distribution centres in Europe
and is the cornerstone of how John Lewis gets products both to stores and
directly to customers.

# What are we looking for?
We are looking to grow our team with the introduction of a technical
trainee.

If you have an interest in IT and would like to contribute to the fast paced
and constantly changing world of modern retail distribution then this may be
the opportunity for you.

Ping over your CV and a couple of sentences on why you'd like a shot to
<jobs@magnapark-jlp.io>. We look forward to hearing from you!
