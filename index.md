We are looking to increase our team with the introduction of a technical
trainee / trainee programmer at our Distribution Centre based in Milton Keynes.

John Lewis Magna Park is one of the largest distribution centres in Europe and
the cornerstone of how John Lewis gets both products into stores and directly
to customers.

If you have an interest in IT, would like to work in the fast paced and
constantly changing world of modern retail distribution and would like to
play a part in making it better, then this may be the opportunity for you.

You will be part of a small and agile team who are responsible for the
specification, development, installation, commissioning, testing and
operational development of a mutli-million pound automated warehouse.

Interested in working in Magna Labs? Ping over your CV and a couple of
sentences on why you would like a shot to <jobs@magnapark-jlp.io>.
